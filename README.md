# ccl_bin

Latest macos(mojave) cannot handle ccl(1.11.5).

ref: https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/issues/146

Roswell's ccl_bin does not support ccl 12 now.

So I host self builded ccl 12 on github.


You can install ccl 12 with roswell, modifying `roswell/lisp/locations.lisp`. Or with some other hack.
